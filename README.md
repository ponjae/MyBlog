# Blog Project with Backend and Styling

Welcome to this project where I intend to build a fully functional blog using flask and bootstrap. I hope you will enjoy it. The project skeleton comes from Angela Yu:s course but the rest of the functionality I intend to implement!

## Get started

1. Make sure you have flask installed, otherwise install it using pip3 etc.
2. Write the following in the terminal: FLASK_APP=main.py
3. Type "flask run" and you should now be good to go.
